# Process Overview üîç

The article creation process can be broken down into the following stages:

- Scrape and load headlines
- Cluster related headlines
- Choose story
- Scrape facts
- Generate brief
- Write article
- Bias checker (temporarily disabled, see NOTE)
- Format article
- Generate headline
- Structure article
- Generate cover image

**NOTE:** The bias checker has been temporarily removed as of 19/04/23. This was implemented when we used GPT-3 for generating the article, however GPT-4 seems to be much more consistent at producing unbiased articles. Using the bias checker with GPT-4 was harming the quality of the article, so it is currently pending improvements.
